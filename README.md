# String-Pattern-Match
Comparative Analysis of Three String Search (Cosine Algorithm, Jaccard Algorithm and Boyer Moore with KMP) Techniques is a simulated desktop application target to test the efficiency of different string search techniques. The procedure is a simple analogy of using different means to achieve something better than good result under different circumstances base on the environment requirement.
In todayâ€™s increasingly online society and with the rapid advances of web site and databases on the internet, the needs for searching and getting a good result cannot be over emphasis, in an environment where multitude of user access the server resources concurrently with little effort to wait and at the same time expecting the best of all result, the needs for effective search result cannot be take likely in other to keep traffic. This application will require a repository to render and execute the code; the application responsible for this is call the JVM to execute the java program and Mysql system that execute on a Xampp or Wampp server to manage the user application data.

Keyword includes: Search Techniques, Databank, Comparative Analysis, Efficiency.
